## <a name="introduction"></a>1.0. Introduction

Delivering teaching and learning at scale is encouraging adoption of “big data” practices.  Cloud computing and machine learning are changing both the learning technology landscape and the business of education.  The definition of what constitutes learning is also evolving beyond the formal classroom experience to include informal, social and experiential modes of acquiring knowledge and skills.  Opportunities exist to leverage new tools, tap new data sources, ask new questions and pursue new insights. 

Consider the enterprising instructor seeking to augment if not transform the classroom environment for her students.  She utilizes a video platform to create and post video assignments.  Class discussions and Q&A sessions are conducted online using another service.  She administers her course using a learning management system.  Three services, three vendors, three potential sources of learning data.  

Analyzing the viewing behavior of her students in relation to the questions they pose about her course content is vital to understanding student comprehension and performance.  Yet exploring such relationships is all too often a challenging exercise.  Likely there are significant barriers to overcome.  Is the data required for analysis actually collected?  If it exists, who owns it?  If ownership is not an issue what about privacy concerns?  If privacy protocols are in place is the data easy to retrieve?  If retrievable how difficult is it to combine with data sourced from other platforms?

The Caliper Analytics&reg; specification seeks to address a number of the issues outlined above by providing a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data.  Establishing a common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.

Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  Industry-wide adoption of Caliper offers the tantalizing prospect of a more unified learning data environment in which to build new and innovative services designed to measure, infer, predict, report and visualize.

### <a name="docStatus"></a>1.1 Status of this Document
This document is considered the _Final Release_.  This means that the Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification, version 1.1, is now made available as a public document following acceptance by IMS Global member organizations, a number of whom have successfully achieved conformance certification at the time of the release of this document.
    
IMS Global strongly encourages its members and the greater public to provide feedback that focuses on improving the Caliper specification. To join the IMS developer and conformance certification community focused on Caliper please visit https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper.
    
Public comments and questions can be posted at the Caliper Analytics&reg; [public forum](https://www.imsglobal.org/forums/ims-glc-public-forums-and-resources/caliper-analytics-public-forum).

### <a name="changes"></a>1.2 Summary of Changes
Caliper 1.1 extends as well as refines the Caliper information model and further describes the ways in which Events and Entities can be expressed as [Linked Data](#linkedDataDef) when authoring documents using [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef).

Three new profiles are provided: the [Basic Profile](#basicProfile), [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) and [ToolUse Profile](#toolUseProfile).  The AssessmentItem Profile has been merged into the [Assessment Profile](#assessmentProfile).  The Outcome Profile has been renamed the [Grading Profile](#gradingProfile) and a new [Score](#score) entity has been added.  Both the [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) and the [ToolUse Profile](#toolUseProfile) add new event types to the Caliper event model: [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent).  New entities and actions are also provided to better describe forum activities and tool use. 

The [ReadingEvent](#readingEvent) has been deprecated while the [OutcomeEvent](#outcomeEvent) has been replaced by the [GradeEvent](#gradeEvent).  Certain action vocabularies have been adjusted as a result of additions and/or removals.  These include actions associated with the [AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent), [AssessmentEvent](#assessmentEvent), [AssessmentItemEvent](#assessmentItemEvent), [AssignableEvent](#assignableEvent) and [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent).  A number of entities have also been deprecated.  The list includes [EpubChapter](#epubChapter), [EpubPart](#epubPart), [EpubSubChapter](#epubSubChapter), [EpubVolume](#epubVolume) and [Reading](#reading). 

Regarding property changes, use of the [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) `@id` and `@type` keywords have been deprecated in favor of `id` and `type`.  The Caliper [Event](#event) now includes an identifier `id` property  as well as new `referrer`, `session` and `extensions` attributes.  [Entity](#entity) property additions, name changes and deprecations also feature in this new release.

[Sensor](#sensor) and [endpoint](#endpoint) behaviors are more fully described and the new specification also clarifies how to express Caliper events and entities in a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document.   A new Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context document is also provided to map Caliper terms to their respective [IRIs](iriDef).
 
This version of the specification is versioned 1.1-errata.01.  It includes a number of minor typographical and text duplication errors uncovered when the document was translated into Korean.

All these changes are described in more detail in [Appendix H. Change Log](#changeLog).

### <a name="conventions"></a>1.3 Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](#rfc2119).  A Sensor implementation that fails to implement a MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL requirement or fails to abide by a MUST NOT/SHALL NOT prohibition is considered nonconformant.  SHOULD/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED statements constitute a best practice.  Ignoring a best practice does not violate conformance but a decision to disregard such guidance should be carefully considered by implementers.  MAY/OPTIONAL statements indicate that implementers are entirely free to choose whether or not to implement the option.

### <a name="terminology"></a>1.4 Terminology

<a name="actorDef"></a>__Actor__: An actor is an [Agent](#agent) capable of initiating or performing an [action](#actionDef) on a thing or as part of a process.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `actor` attribute for representing the [Agent](#agent). 

<a name="blankNodeDef"></a>__Blank Node Identifier__: a string that begins with "_:" that is used to identify an [Entity](#entity) for which an [IRI](#iriDef) is not provided.  An [Entity](#entity) provisioned with a blank node identifier is neither dereferenceable nor has meaning outside the scope of the [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document within which it resides.

<a name="actionDef"></a>__Action__: something performed or done to accomplish a purpose.  Caliper [Event](#event) subtypes define a controlled vocabulary of one or more [actions](#actions) relevant to the activity domain.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `action` attribute for expressing the associated action.     

<a name="contextDef"></a>__Context__: a special [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) keyword that maps the terms employed in a JSON document to [IRIs](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt) that link to one or more published vocabularies.  Inclusion of a [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) context provides an economical way of communicating document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event data.

<a name="describeDef"></a>__Describe__: a Caliper message containing an [Entity](#entity) that is not directly associated with an [Event](#event). Entities can be sent asynchronously from events using `Describe` messages in order to reduce verbosity (e.g. sending a [Person](#person) entity as a `Describe` avoids having to repeat the [Person](#person) object in each [Event](#event) that includes it).

<a name="endpointDef"></a>__Endpoint__: a receiver or consumer of Caliper data that is bound to a specific network protocol.  

<a name="entityDef"></a>__Entity__: an object or a thing that participates in learning-related activity.  Caliper [Entity](#entity) types provide coarsed-grained representations of applications, people, groups and resources that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper [Event](#event).  Each [Entity](#entity) corresponds to a node in a directed graph.

<a name="envelopeDef"></a>__Envelope__: a data structure that serves as a transport container of Caliper [Event](#eventDef) and [Entity](#entityDef) data.  The envelope also includes metadata about the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) and the data payload.

<a name="eventDef"></a>__Event__: describes a relationship established between an [Agent](#agent) (the `actor`) and an [Entity](#entity) (the `object`) formed as a result of a purposeful `action` undertaken by the `actor` in connection to the `object` at a particular moment in time.

<a name="jsonldDef"></a>__JSON-LD__: a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with [Linked Data](#linkedData).  The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that support [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/).

<a name="iriDef"></a>__IRI__: The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) extends the Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI](#uriDef)) scheme by using characters drawn from the Universal character set rather than US-ASCII per [RFC 3987](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  [Linked Data](#linkedData) rely on IRIs to refer to most nodes and properties.

<a name="iso8601Def"></a>__ISO 8601__: Caliper data and time values are formatted per ISO 8601 with the addition of millisecond precision.  The format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ where 'T' separates the date from the time while 'Z' indicates that the time is set to UTC.

<a name="linkedDataDef"></a>__Linked Data__: A set of design principles first articulated by Tim Berners-Lee for discovering, connecting, and sharing structured data over the Web.  The principles can be summarized as follows: use [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) as names for things; use HTTP [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) so that information about things (e.g., people, objects, concepts) can be retrieved using a standard format; link out to other relevant things by way of their [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) in order to promote discovery of new relationships between things.

<a name="lisDef"></a>__LIS__: Learning Information Services&reg; (LIS&reg;) is an IMS standard that defines how systems manage the exchange of information that describes people, groups, memberships, courses and outcomes.
 
<a name="ltiDef"></a>__LTI__: Learning Tools Interoperability&reg; (LTI&reg;) is an IMS standard for integration of rich learning applications within educational environments.

<a name="metricProfileDef"></a>__Metric Profile__: models a learning activity or a supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner using a shared vocabulary.

<a name="objectDef"></a>__Object__: an [Entity](#entity) that an [Agent](#agent) interacts with that becomes the focus, target or object of an interaction.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `object` attribute for representing the resource.

<a name="sensorDef"></a>__Sensor__: Software assets deployed within a learning application that implement the [Sensor API&trade;](#sensorAPIDef) for marshalling and transmitting Caliper data to a target endpoint.

<a name="sensorAPIDef"></a>__Sensor API&trade;__: The standard set of methods and supported parameters that a [Sensor](#sensorDef) implements according to this specification in order to transmit Caliper data in an interoperable way.

<a name="termDef"></a>__Term__: a word or short expression that expands to an [IRI](#iriDef) when mapped to a JSON-LD [context](#contextDef) document. Terms are employed by Caliper as `type` property string values in order to distinguish between various JSON representations of entities and events defined by the Caliper information model.

<a name="typeCoercionDef"></a>__Type Coercion__: the process of coercing values to a particular data type.

<a name="uriDef"></a>__URI__:  the Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI](#uriDef)) utilizes the US-ASCII character set to identify a resource.  Per [RFC 2396](#rfc2396) a [URI](#uriDef) "can be further classified as a locator, a name or both."  Both the Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](#urlDef)) and the Uniform Resource Name ([URN](#urnDef)) are considered subspaces of the more general [URI](#uriDef) space. 

<a name="urlDef"></a>__URL__: A Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](#urlDef)) is a type of [URI](#uriDef) that provides a reference to resource that specifies both its location and a means of retrieving a representation of it.  An HTTP [URI](#uriDef) is a [URL](#urlDef) and using HTTP IRIs/URIs to identify things is fundamental to Linked Data.

<a name="urnDef"></a>__URN__: A Uniform Resource Name ([URN](#urnDef)) is a type of [URI](#uriDef) that provides a persistent identifier for a resource that is bound to a defined namespace.  Unlike a [URL](#urlDef) a [URN](#urnDef) is location-independent and provides no means of accessing a representation of the named resource.  

<a name="uuidDef"></a>__UUID__: a 128-bit identifier that does not require a registration authority to assure uniqueness.  However, absolute uniqueness is not guaranteed although the collision probability is considered extremely low. Caliper recommends use of randomly or pseudo-randomly generated version 4 UUIDs.  Each Caliper [Event](#event) MUST be assigned a UUID that is expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` as described in [RFC 4122](#rfc4122).

## <a name="infoModel"></a>2.0 The Information Model 

The Caliper information model defines a set of concepts, rules, and relationships for describing learning activities.  Each activity domain modeled is described in a [Metric Profile](#infoModelProfiles) ("profile").  Each profile is composed of one or more [Event](#event) types.  Each [Event](#event) defines a controlled vocabulary of [actions](#actions) undertaken by learners, instructors, and others, that are scoped to the event.  Various [Entity](#entity) types representing people, groups, and resources are provided in order to better describe both the relationships established between participating entities and the contextual elements relevant to the interaction.

### <a name="event"></a>2.1 The Caliper Event

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Event Model" src="assets/caliper-event_model_no_title-v3.png"></div>

A Caliper [Event](#event) is a generic type that describes the relationship established between an `actor` and an `object`, formed as a result of a purposeful [action](#actions) undertaken by the `actor` at a particular moment in time and within a given learning context.  The [Event](#event) properties `actor`, `action` and `object` form a compact data structure that resembles an [RDF](#rdf) triple linking a subject to an object via a predicate.  A learner starting an assessment, annotating a reading, pausing a video, or posting a message to a forum, are examples of learning activities that Caliper models as events.

Caliper defines a number of [Event](#event) subtypes, each scoped to a particular activity domain and distinguishable by a `type` attribute.  The `type` value is a string that MUST match the [Term](#termDef) specified for the [Event](#event) by the Caliper information model (e.g. "MessageEvent").  Each [Event](#event) instance is assigned a 128-bit long universally unique identifier (UUID) formatted as a [URN](#urnDef) per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122), which describes a [URN](#urnDef) namespace for [UUIDs](#uuidDef).  

The information model also seeks to describe the learning environment or context in which a learning activity is situated.  Group affiliation, membership roles and status, recent navigation history, supporting technology and session information can all be optionally represented.  An [Entity](#entity) generated as a result of the interaction between an `actor` and an `object` can also be described; annotating a piece of digital content and producing an [Annotation](#annotation) is one such example.  An `extensions` property is also provided so that implementers can add custom attributes not described by the model.  

#### Properties
Considered as a data structure an [Event](#event) constitutes an unordered set of key:value pairs that is semi-structured by design.  Optional attributes can be ignored when describing an [Event](#event).  An [Entity](#entity) participating in an [Event](#event) can be represented as an object or as a string that corresponds to the [IRI](#iriDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity).

The base set of [Event](#event) properties or attributes is listed below.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  The `id`, `type`, `actor`, `action`, `object` and `eventTime` properties are required; all other properties are optional.  Custom attributes not described by the model MAY be included but MUST be added to the `extensions` property as a map of key:value pairs.  Properties with a value of *null* or empty SHOULD be excluded prior to serialization.

| Property | Type | Description | Disposition |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [UUID](#uuidDef) | The emitting application MUST provision the [Event](#event) with a [UUID](#uuidDef).  A version 4 [UUID](#uuidDef) SHOULD be generated.  The UUID MUST be expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122). | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Event](#event) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document.  For a generic [Event](#event) set the `type` to the string value *Event*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the `type` to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *NavigationEvent*. | Required |
| actor | [Agent](#agent) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | The [Agent](#agent) who initiated the [Event](#event), typically though not always a [Person](#person).  The `actor` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the actor's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| action | [Term](#termDef) | The action or predicate that binds the actor or subject to the object.  The `action` range is limited to the set of [actions](#actions) described in this specification and may be further constrained by the chosen [Event](#event) type.  Only one `action` [Term](#termDef) may be specified per [Event](#event). | Required |
| object | [Entity](#entity) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | The [Entity](#entity) that comprises the object of the interaction.  The `object` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the object's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| eventTime | DateTime | An ISO 8601 date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates when the [Event](#event) occurred.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Required |
| target | [Entity](#entity) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | An [Entity](#entity) that represents a particular segment or location within the `object`.  The `target` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the target entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| generated | [Entity](#entity) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef)  | An [Entity](#entity) created or generated as a result of the interaction.  The `generated` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the generated entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| edApp | [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) that constitutes the application context.  The `edApp` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the edApp's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| referrer | [Entity](#entity) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | An [Entity](#entity) that represents the referring context. A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) or [DigitalResource](#digitalResource) will typically constitute the referring context.  The `referrer` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the referrer's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| group | [Organization](#organization) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | An [Organization](#organization) that represents the group context.  The `group` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the group's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| membership | [Membership](#membership) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | The relationship between the `actor` and the `group` in terms of roles assigned and current status.  The `membership` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the membership entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| session | [Session](#session) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | The current user [Session](#session).  The `session` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the session's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional | 
| federatedSession | [LtiSession](#ltiSession) &#124; [IRI](#iriDef) | If the [Event](#event) occurs within the context of an [LTI](#ltiDef) tool launch, the actor's tool consumer [LtiSession](#ltiSession) MAY be referenced.  The `federatedSession` value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the federatedSession's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| extensions | Object | A map of additional attributes not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Event](#event). | Optional |

#### Subtypes
[AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent), [AssignableEvent](#assignableEvent), [AssessmentEvent](#assessmentEvent), [AssessmentItemEvent](#assessmentItemEvent), [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [GradeEvent](#gradeEvent), [SessionEvent](#sessionEvent), [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

#### Deprecated subtypes

### <a name="entity"></a>2.2 The Caliper Entity

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Caliper Entities" src="assets/caliper-entities-v2.png"></div>

A Caliper [Entity](#entity) is a generic type that represents objects that participate in learning-related activities.  A variety of [Entity](#entity) subtypes have been defined in order to better describe people, groups, organizations, digital content, courses, software applications, and other objects that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper [Event](#event).  Each [Entity](#entity) is provisioned with a modest set of properties or attributes that support discovery and description.

Caliper permits [Entity](#entity) values to be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the resource's [IRI](#iriDef).
  
If the [Entity](#entity) is expressed as an object, both the `id` and `type` properties MUST be specified.  The `type` value is a string that MUST match the term specified for the [Entity](#entity) by the Caliper information model (e.g. "Person").  The `id` value is a string that MUST be expressed as an [IRI](#iriDef).  The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be valid and unique.  The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD also be dereferenceable, i.e., capable of returning a representation of the resource assuming authorization to access the resource is granted.  A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided although care should be taken when employing a location-independent identifier since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it to retrieve machine-readable data over HTTP. 

Other [Entity](#entity) properties are descriptive in nature, or link the [Entity](#entity) to other related entities.  Certain [Entity](#entity) subtypes like [Annotation](#annotation), [DigitalResource](#digitalResource), [Message](#message) or [Organization](#organization) are provisioned with additional properties that allow for a more complete representation of the object.  An `extensions` property is also defined so that implementers can add custom attributes not described by the model.  Optional properties can be ignored when describing an [Entity](#entity).    

#### Properties
Like an [Event](#event), an [Entity](#entity) is considered semi-structured data consisting of an unordered set of key:value pairs.  The base set of [Entity](#entity) properties is listed below.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  When representing an [Entity](#entity) as an object the `id` and `type` properties are required; all other properties are optional and need not be referenced when describing an [Entity](#entity).  Custom attributes not described by the model MAY be included but MUST be added to the `extensions` property as a map of key:value pairs.  Properties with a value of *null* or empty SHOULD be excluded prior to serialization. 
 
| Property | Type | Description | Disposition |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [IRI](#iriDef) | A valid [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be specified. The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be unique and persistent. The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD also be dereferenceable, i.e., capable of returning a representation of the resource. A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided in cases where a [Linked Data](#linkedDataDef) friendly HTTP URI is either unavailable or inappropriate. | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document.  For a generic [Entity](#entity) set the `type` value to the term *Entity*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the type to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *Person*. | Required |
| name | string | A string value comprising a word or phrase by which the [Entity](#entity) is known. | Optional |
| description | string |  A string value comprising a brief, written representation of the [Entity](#entity). | Optional |
| dateCreated | DateTime | An ISO 8601 date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was created.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Optional |
| dateModified | DateTime | An ISO 8601 date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was last changed or updated.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Optional |
| extensions | Object | A map of additional attributes not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Entity](#entity). | Optional |

## <a name="profiles"></a>3.0 Metric Profiles

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Metric Profiles" src="assets/caliper-profiles-v3.png"></div>

The Caliper information model defines a number of metric profiles, each of which models a learning activity or a supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  A metric profile's *raison d'etre* is to encourage vocabulary standardization and re-use among application providers delivering complementary, albeit competing capabilities that collect learning activity data.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner using a shared vocabulary.  Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment submission represent a few examples of the many activities or events that Caliper's metric profiles attempt to describe.
    
Think of each metric profile as a stand-alone, logical container, or collection of one or more Caliper events that together help describe a set of inter-related activities.  Each [Event](#event) type included in a metric profile place constraints on the various entities and actions that can be utilized to describe a learning activity.  Vocabulary restrictions are outlined in each profile description under the following headings:

* supported events
* supported actors
* supported actions
* supported objects
* supported generated entities
* supported target entities
* other requirements

As an example, the [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) models a set of activities associated with online discussions involving instructors and learners. The profile currently includes a [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent) and [ViewEvent](#viewEvent).  An action sequence mediated by the [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) might involve a learner navigating to a forum, subscribing to it, viewing a thread, posting a message in reply to an earlier post and then marking the message as read.
     
Extending Caliper's information model involves designing a new metric profile or enhancing an existing one.  Implementers are free to implement only those Caliper metric profiles as are necessary to model a learning domain.  A video platform provider may decide that only the [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Media Profile](#mediaProfile) and [Session Profile](#sessionProfile) are relevant to its needs, while developers instrumenting an assessment engine would most likely implement the [Assessment Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Grading Profile](#gradingProfile) and [Session Profile](#sessionProfile).

The following metric profiles are currently available and are summarized individually below:

[Annotation Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assessment Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Forum Profile](#forumProfile), [Media Profile](#mediaProfile), [Grading Profile](#gradingProfile), [Reading Profile](#readingProfile), [Session Profile](#sessionProfile), [Tool Use Profile](#toolUseProfile), [Basic Profile](#basicProfile)

### <a name="annotationProfile"></a>3.1 Annotation Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Annotation Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_annotation.png"></div>

The Caliper Annotation Profile models activities related to the annotation of a [DigitalResource](#digitalResource). Creating a bookmark, highlighting selected text, sharing a resource, tagging a document, and viewing an annotation are modeled.  The generated [Annotation](#annotation) is also described and is subtyped for greater type specificity.

As an example, instructors can use the places where students are making notes in the course material to determine whether they have the right idea about which material should be highlighted.  In addition, if there are students who are asking questions or making notes indicating confusion about a particular piece of content, this can also inform the instructor about the suitability or quality of the material which they have chosen to use.  

Questions which can be answered using this profile are as follows:

* Which students are generating annotations?
* What content is most often annotated?
* What types of annotations are being created?
* Which segments of text are being highlighted?
* What tags are being used?
* What notes are being added?

#### Supported Events
[AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent)

#### Supported Actors
[Person](#person)

#### Supported Actions
[Bookmarked](#bookmarked), [Highlighted](#highlighted), [Shared](#shared), [Tagged](#tagged)

#### Supported Objects
[DigitalResource](#digitalResource)

#### Supported Generated Entities
[BookmarkAnnotation](#bookmarkAnnotation), [HighlightAnnotation](#highlightAnnotation), [SharedAnnotation](#sharedAnnotation), [TaggedAnnotation](#taggedAnnotation)

#### Other Requirements
* For each [AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent) described, the `generated` [Annotation](#annotation) subtype SHOULD be specified.  Pair the `action` with the appropriate [Annotation](#annotation) subtype (e.g., [Bookmarked](#bookmarked) with [BookmarkAnnotation](#bookmarkAnnotation)).  If the generated [Annotation](#annotation) is expressed as an object both the `annotator` and `annotated` entities SHOULD be referenced.

### <a name="assessmentProfile"></a>3.2 Assessment Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Assessment Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_assessment.png"></div>

The Caliper Assessment Profile models assessment-related activities including interactions with individual assessment items. Caliper provides [Assessment](#assessment) and [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem) entities for describing the `object` of these activities, as well as a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) for recording a count of the number of times an assigned resource has been attempted.  Five [Response](#response) types are also provided for capturing individual item responses.  _Note that the Caliper 1.0 AssessmentItem Profile has been merged into the Assessment Profile._

Tracking patterns using the assessment profile will allow instructors to understand more about how students are interacting with their assessments.  Typical ways to make use of this profile are to answer the following questions:

* How much time is required to complete and submit an assessment?
* How much time is spent answering individual questions?
* Which questions are completed?
* Which questions are skipped?
* If test-taking times are flexible, when do learners start their assessments?

If the [Attempt](#attempt) is expressed as an object the [Attempt](#attempt) SHOULD define, at a minimum, the `assignee`, the `assignable`, and the `count`.  Set the [Attempt](#attempt) `count` values as follows (per action):
  * [Started](#started): set the `count` value to 1 for a first attempt and increment by 1 for each subsequent attempt.
  * [Paused](#paused), [Resumed](#resumed), [Reset](#reset): do not change the current `count` value.
  * [Restarted](#restarted): increment the `count` value by 1.
* For each [AssessmentItemEvent](#assessmentItemEvent) described, referencing a `generated` [Attempt](#attempt) or [Response](#response) depends on the `action` value specified.  Set the [Attempt](#attempt) `count` values as follows (per action): 
  * [Started](#started): set the `count` value to 1 for a first attempt and increment by 1 for each subsequent attempt.
  * [Skipped](#skipped): do not specify an [Attempt](#attempt).
  * [Completed](#completed): if desired, specify the learner's [Response](#response) and reference the associated [Attempt](#attempt) via the `attempt` property.  The current `count` value MUST remain unchanged.
* Parent-child relationships that exist between [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem) and [Assessment](#assessment) attempts MAY be represented by use of the [Attempt](#attempt) `isPartOf` property.
* As a learner navigates from one [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem) to another [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem), the previous [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem) MAY be specified as the `referrer`.

### <a name="assignableProfile"></a>3.3 Assignable Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Assignable Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_assignable.png"></div>

The Assignable Profile models activities associated with the assignment of digital content to a learner for completion according to specific criteria.  Caliper provides a generic [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource) for describing the `object` of these activities as well as a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) for recording a count of the number of times an assigned resource has been attempted.

This profile would be useful for instructors to gather insight about the relationship between students and their assignments.  Answers to the following questions can be enabled using this profile:

* Who is assigned what material?
* How long does it take to complete something that has been assigned?
* What piece of assigned material presents the biggest challenge (i.e. needs most retake attempts)

* Parent-child relationships that exist between [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource) attempts MAY be represented by use of the [Attempt](#attempt) `isPartOf` property.

### <a name="forumProfile"></a>3.4 Forum Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Forum Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_forum.png"></div>

The Caliper Forum Profile models learners and others participating in online forum communities.  Forums typically encompass one or more threads or topics to which members can subscribe, post messages and reply to other messages if a threaded discussion is permitted.  Caliper provides [Forum](#forum), [Thread](#thread) and [Message](#message) entities for representing the `object` of these activities.

Tracking patterns using the forum profile will allow instructors to understand more about how students are engaged within discussion forums.  Using this profile, instructors can gain insight in the following areas:

* Who is posting most often
* Which posts create the most replies?
* Compare graded vs. non-graded discussions

#### Supported Events
[ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

* Parent-child relationships that exist between a [Message](#message), [Thread](#thread) and a [Forum](#forum) MAY be represented by use of the `isPartOf` property.

### <a name="gradingProfile"></a>3.5 Grading Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Grading Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_grading.png"></div>

The Caliper Grading Profile models grading activities performed by an [Agent](#agent), typically a [Person](#person) or a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication).  Grading a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) of an [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource) and generating a [Score](#score) is modeled. _Note that the Caliper 1.0 Outcomes Profile has been replaced by the Grading Profile._

The grading profile allows information to be captured about grade changes for a given assessment or submission.  This may be useful to understand the way in which students and teachers may be interacting throughout the course.  For example, the grading profile can be used to answer questions such as:

* How often are grades changed for an assessment?

#### Supported Events
[GradeEvent](#gradeEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

#### Supported Actors

##### GradeEvent
[Agent](#agent)

##### ViewEvent

#### Other Requirements
* When describing a [GradeEvent](#gradeEvent), the `generated` [Score](#score) SHOULD be specified.
* For auto-graded scenarios the [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) MUST be specified as the `actor`.

### <a name="mediaProfile"></a>3.6 Media Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Media Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_media.png"></div>

The Caliper Media Profile models interactions between learners and rich content such as audio, images and video.  Implementers can leverage a number of media-related entities including [AudioObject](#audioObject), [ImageObject](#audioObject) and [VideoObject](#videoObject), each subtyped from a generic [MediaObject](#mediaObject).  A [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation) entity is also provided in order to represent the current location in an audio or video stream.

As an example of how this profile could be used, consider the following scenario: an instructor has decided to incorporate a video player into their course.  The video content may or may not be launched via [LTI](#ltiDef) from the Learning Management System (LMS).  Since the video player tool is instrumented to emit activity data via Caliper, the instructor will be able to collect useful information about student viewing behavior.  In addition, he will be able to compare this data along with other relevent information in the LMS, such as assignment and quiz results.  Using data collected via Caliper, instructors (and administrators) can answer key questions, such as:
 
* Who is using the tool?
* Which videos are being played the most?
* How long are they spending on each video?
* Where do they pause the video?
* Are there instances of where students are replaying sections of the video?

#### Supported Events
[MediaEvent](#mediaEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

#### Supported Actors
[Person](#person)

#### Supported Actions

* If the [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation) is expressed as an object, set the `currentTime` value as follows (per action):
  * [Started](#started), [Restarted](#restarted): set the `currentTime` value to the beginning or initial starting location in the audio or video stream.
  * [Paused](#paused): set the `currentTime` value to the location in the audio or video stream where the pause occurred.
  * [Resumed](#resumed): set the `currentTime` value to the location in the audio or video stream where the previous pause occurred.
  * [Ended](#ended): set the `currentTime` value to the ending or closing location in the audio or video stream.
  * For other [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent) supported actions the [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation) `currentTime` value MUST be set to the location in the audio or video stream where the action occurred.

### <a name="readingProfile"></a>3.7 Reading Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Reading Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_reading.png"></div>

The Caliper Reading Profile models activities associated with navigating to and viewing digital textual content.  Caliper provides a number of entities representing digital content including a generic [DigitalResource](#digitalResource) and  [DigitalResourceCollection](#digitalResourceCollection) along with [Document](#document), [Chapter](#chapter), [Page](#page), [WebPage](#webPage), [Message](#message) and [Frame](#frame).  

Instructors and researchers can utilize data collected via the Reading Profile to answer questions such as:

* Who is consuming the content?
* What materials are being accessed?
* When are the resources accessed?
* How often is the content viewed?
* What paths are taken to reach the content?

When used in conjunction with the Assessment Profile viewing patterns can be correlated to performance measures.

#### Supported Events
[NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

#### Supported Actors
[Person](#person)

#### Supported Actions

##### NavigationEvent
[NavigatedTo](#navigatedTo)

##### ViewEvent

#### Supported Target Entities
The following [Entity](#entity) types are supported:

* [Frame](#frame)

#### Other Requirements
* A [Frame](#frame) MAY be specified as the `target` in order to indicate an indexed segment or location.

### <a name="sessionProfile"></a>3.8 Session Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Session Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_session.png"></div>

The Caliper Session Profile models the creation and subsequent termination of a user session established by a [Person](#person) interacting with a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication).  A [Session](#session) entity is described for representing the user session.

The session profile can facilitate the capture of data about who is logging into the learning environment, and more importantly, which students are not logging in.   The following are examples of the information best captured using the session profile:

* Session logins
* Which students have not logged in for more than a week
* Who logs in/logs out most/least

#### Supported Events
[SessionEvent](#sessionEvent)

#### Supported Actors
[Person](#person), [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication)

#### Supported Actions
[LoggedIn](#loggedIn), [LoggedOut](#loggedOut), [TimedOut](#timedOut)

#### Supported Objects
[SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication), [Session](#session)

#### Supported Target Entities
[DigitalResource](#digitalResource)

#### Other Requirements
* Although optional, the relevant user `session` SHOULD be specified.
* For a [LoggedIn](#loggedIn) action, if the `actor` is attempting to access a particular [DigitalResource](#digitalResource) the resource MAY be designated as the `target` of the interaction.
* For a [TimedOut](#timedOut) action, the [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) MUST be specified as the `actor` and the [Session](#session) MUST be specified as the `object`.

### <a name="toolUseProfile"></a>3.9 Tool Use Profile

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Tool Use Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_tool_use.png"></div>

The Caliper Tool Use Profile models an intended interaction between a user and a tool.  In other words, when a [Person](#person) utilizes a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) in a manner that the application determines to be its "intended use for learning", an application that implements the Tool Use Profile can emit a [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) indicating such usage.

The Tool Use Profile enables the gathering of basic usage information. It provides an easy way to get started with a base level of instrumentation by allowing the learning tool to make the determination of its own use.   Any learning app can be instrumented using this profile to detect when a student accesses the tool and uses it in the way it was intended.   Common questions that can be answered by using this profile include:

* What tools are being used, and how much?
* Who is the most active/least active user of tools?
* Does tool usage help/hinder student performance?
* Which tools have the greatest impact on student performance?

#### Supported Events
[ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent)

#### Supported Actors
[Person](#person)

#### Supported Actions
[Used](#used)

#### Supported Objects
[SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication)

### <a name="basicProfile"></a>3.10 Basic Profile

## <a name="dataSerialization"></a>4.0 Serialization of the Model

Over the last decade the advent of cloud-based, networked applications have led to changes in the way data is structured and represented.  Data once considered strictly hierarchical, like a curriculum, a course roster, or a transcript now frequently link out to other kinds of data.  Modeling bundles of data pointing to other bundles of data now requires thinking in terms of graphs and [Linked Data](#linkedData).  Caliper [Event](#event) data presents us with similar structures.  A Caliper [Event](#event) can link to user data, digital content, courses and rosters, grades and credentials, institutional and organizational data, application and session data, and so on, the sources of which are likely diverse and the opportunities for discovering new relationships between the entities represented therein both numerous as well as enlightening.

Exchanging data linked to other data distributed across a wide network requires both a simple, well-understood data-interchange format as well as means of defining unambiguously the underlying semantics or meaning intended for the data structures transmitted from one machine to another.  For Caliper, [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) provides the necessary representational horsepower to both describe these kinds of data linkages and specify how data is to be understood when published and shared across a network.
  
[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) defines an economical syntax for representing learning activity data as [Linked Data](#linkedData) using [JSON](#jsonDef) as the underlying data-interchange format.  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) also provides an API and set of processing algorithms for working with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents that are based on different contexts.  Algorithms have also been developed to serialize [RDF](#rdf) as [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) and deserialize a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document to an [RDF](#rdf) data set.

### <a name="jsonldContext"></a>4.1 JSON-LD Context

[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents require inclusion of a *context*, denoted by the `@context` keyword, a property employed to map document [Terms](#termDef) to [IRIs](#iriDef).  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) contexts can be embedded inline or referenced externally in a document.  Inclusion of a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context provides an economical way for Caliper to communicate document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event data.

IMS Global provides a remote Caliper 1.1 [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context document (http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) for mapping Caliper [Terms](#termDef) to [IRIs](#iriDef).  Implementers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the term definitions described therein. 

#### Requirements
* Each Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* document generated by a [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be provisioned with a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) `@context` defined as a property of the top-level object.
* The top-level `@context` property type MUST be defined as a string or an array.
* If the top-level `@context` value is defined as a string it MUST be set to the Caliper remote context URL "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1".
* If the top-level `@context` value is defined as an array of multiple contexts, the remote Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context MUST be listed last in order to ensure that Caliper terms retain their primacy given that [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) parsers rely on a "most-recently-defined-wins" approach when evaluating duplicate terms.
* Referencing the remote Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context document in the top-level `@context` is mandatory.  The terms it defines MUST NOT be defined inline as an object.
* Additional remote or inline _local_ contexts may be referenced any time a JSON object is defined in order to ascribe meaning to terms not described by the model.  These contexts are additive in nature and can be defined as a string, object or array.  Duplicate context references SHOULD be omitted when serializing the object.  Nested _local_ contexts that are added to the _active_ context at processing time MUST NOT override Caliper terms defined by the top-level context.

In the following example, `@context` is a top-level [Event](#event) property with a value that references the remote Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context document.  All of the [Event](#event) key:value pairings are mapped to [IRIs] in the referenced context.

#### Example: referencing the Caliper JSON-LD context
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "Event",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Created",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/resources/123",
    "type": "Document"
  },
  "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

As noted above, a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document can reference more than one context.  Subject to the requirements listed above additional contexts MAY be defined for a Caliper [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* in order to map non-Caliper vocabulary terms to their respective [IRIs](#iriDef).

#### Example: Referencing multiple contexts

##### Correct order (Caliper context listed last)
```
{
  "@context": ["https://schema.org/docs/jsonldcontext.json", "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1"]
  . . .
}
```

Contexts embedded inline can be combined with externally referenced contexts.  Again, order matters.

#### Example: Combining inline and referenced contexts
```
{
  "@context": [
    {
      "query": "http://schema.org/query"
    },
    "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1"
  ],
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "Event",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Searched",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/resources/123",
    "type": "Document"
  },
  "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z",
  "extensions": {
    "query": "Event OR Entity"
  }
}
```  

### <a name="jsonldIdentifiers"></a>4.2 Identifiers

[Linked Data](#linkedData) relies on [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDefs) for the identification and retrieval of resources.  Likewise, [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) specifies the use of [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDefs) for identifying most nodes (i.e., JSON objects) and their attributes.  Caliper too specifies the use of [IRIs](#iriDef) for identifying nodes (i.e., the things or entities being described) and their attributes.  

[IRI](#iriDef) values MUST be absolute containing a scheme, path and optional query and fragment segments.  A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be used as an identifier although care should be taken when employing a location-independent identifier since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it in future to retrieve machine-readable data over HTTP.  If an [IRI](#iriDef) is deemed inappropriate for the resource a [blank node](#blankNodeDef) identifier may be assigned.

[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) provides a special `@id` keyword for assigning identifiers to nodes.  For Caliper, the [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) `@id` keyword is aliased as `id` in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  This is done in order to avoid the temptation of employing [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) keywords as property names and is aligned with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) community practice.  Thus, each Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) described by the model is provisioned with an `id` rather than `@id` property for identifying the resource.

Every [Entity](#entity) MUST be assigned an identifier in the form of a valid [IRI](#iriDef) or a blank node identifier. The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be unique and persistent.  The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD be dereferenceable; i.e., capable of returning a representation of the [Entity](#entity).  A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY also be utilized.

Unlike Entities, each [Event](#event) MUST be assigned a 128-bit long universally unique identifier ([UUID](#uuidDef)) formatted as a [URN](#urnDef) per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122), which describes a [URN](#urnDef) namespace for [UUIDs](#uuidDef).

#### Example: Event and Entity identifiers
```
{
  . . .
  "id": "urn:uuid:ff9ec22a-fc59-4ae1-ae8d-2c9463ee2f8f",
  "type": "NavigationEvent",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  . . .
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/pages/2",
    "type": "WebPage",
    . . .
  },
  . . .
}
```

### <a name="jsonldTypes"></a>4.3 Types and Type Coercion

[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) employs the `@type` keyword in two ways.  Individual *nodes* (i.e., the thing being described) can be assigned a type.  Values can also be associated with or *coerced* to a particular type.  Both node types and typed values are specified in the Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  As with the aliasing of `@id` as `id`, the `@type` keyword is aliased as `type` in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) in keeping with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) community practice.

Caliper permits [Entity](#entity) values to be expressed either as a JSON object or as a string corresponding to its [IRI](#iriDef).  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) also supports the _coercion_ of data values to specified types based on value type mappings defined in a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context.  For a given `@type` the keywords `@id` or `@vocab` may be assigned as a value in order to signal to a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) parser that if a term's instance value is set to a string it is to be interpreted as an [IRI](#iriDef).  Type coercion of this sort provides representational flexibility that implementers are encouraged to leverage.

The following [MessageEvent](#messageEvent) example utilizes an inline context to illustrate how [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) types can be specified in a context.  The [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [Person](#person) and [Message](#message) terms are all considered node types.  Other terms illustrate the coercion of values to specified data types.  In the example below, the values of the `actor`, `object` and `edApp` terms are coerced to the `@id` keyword. Use of this convention informs [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) parsers that string values are to be interpreted as [IRIs](#iriDef) (as in the case of `edApp`).  In a like manner, the `action` value is coerced to the `@vocab` keyword indicating that the value is to be interpreted as a [Term](#termDef) defined in the active context or as an [IRI](#iriDef); in this case *Posted*.  Terms such as `name`, `description`, `dateCreated`, `dateModified` and `duration` are coerced to a particular value type such as a string, integer, boolean or date.
 
#### Example: node and value types
```

  },
  "eventTime": "2018-12-15T10:15:00.000Z",
  "edApp": "https://example.edu"
}
```

As the abbreviated [ForumEvent](#forumEvent) example below demonstrates, in cases where an [Event](#event) references the same [Entity](#entity) more than once (e.g., `actor`, `member`, `user`; `group`, `organization`), or a property is associated with a specific type (e.g., `edApp`) or an [Entity](#entity) possesses an [IRI](#iriDef) that is dereferenceable, consider expressing the value as a string corresponding to the entity's [IRI](#iriDef).

#### Example: `membership` and `session` references to `actor` and `group` expressed as IRIs
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",
  "type": "ForumEvent",

    . . .

    "organization": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1",
    "roles": [ "Learner" ],
    . . .
  },
  "session": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/sessions/1f6442a482de72ea6ad134943812bff564a76259",

  }
}
```

Indeed, the example [ForumEvent](#forumEvent) could be thinned still further if each referenced [Entity](#entity) is provisioned with a dereferenceable [IRI](#iriDef) that permits consumers to retrieve a more robust representation of the object if required.

#### Example: Thinned ForumEvent comprised of (dereferenceable) IRI values
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",

## <a name="sensor"></a>5.0 The Sensor API&trade;

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Caliper Sensor" src="assets/caliper-sensor-v2.png"></div>

Caliper defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and transmitting data to a target endpoints.  Adopting one or more [metric profiles](#metricProfiles) ensures adherence to the information model; implementing the [Sensor](#sensor) provides instrumented platforms, applications and services with a transport interface for communicating with data consumers.

### <a name="sensorBehavior"></a>5.1 Behavior

A [Sensor](#sensor) MUST implement the following behaviors:

* create in-memory object representations of Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) types as described in Section [2.0](#infoModel).  The particular [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) types that a [Sensor](#sensor) must be capable of expressing are determined by the [Metric Profiles](#metricProfileDef) implemented as described in Section [3.0](#profiles).    
* express [Entity](#entity) values as either an object or a string corresponding to the resource's [IRI](#iriDef) as described in Section [2.2](#entity).
* serialize in-memory [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) objects as [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) as described in Section [4.0](#dataSerialization).  
* create an in-memory object representation of a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) as described in Section [5.2](#envelope).
* serialize in-memory Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) objects as JSON as described in Section [5.2](#envelope).  [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* data serialized as JSON-LD MUST be transmitted inside an [Envelope](#envelope) as described in Sections [5.2](#envelope) and [5.3](#jsonldPayload).
* transmit serialized Caliper [Envelopes](#envelope) containing [Event](#event) and/or [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* data to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint) over HTTP as described in Section [5.4](#httpRequest).

A [Sensor](#sensor) MAY be assigned other responsibilities such as validating Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) data but such capabilities need not be exposed to learning data providers.  

### <a name="envelope"></a>5.2 Envelope

Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) data MUST be transmitted inside a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope), a purpose-built JSON data structure that includes metadata about the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) and the data payload.

#### Properties
Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) properties are listed below.  The `sensor`, `sendTime`, `dataVersion` and `data` properties are required.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  No custom properties are permitted.

| Property | Type | Description | Disposition |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| sensor | string | A unique identifier assigned either to the [Sensor](#sensor) or to the instrumented platform, application or service utilizing the [Sensor](#sensor).  The identifier SHOULD be in the form of an [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| sendTime | DateTime | A date and time string value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates the time at which the [Sensor](#sensor) issued the message.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Required |
| dataVersion | string | A string value indicating which version of the IMS Caliper Analytics&reg; specification governs the form of the Caliper entities and events contained in the `data` payload. The value MUST be set to the IMS Caliper [Context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) [IRI](#iriDef) used to resolve the meanings of the `data` payload's terms and values. | Required |
| data | Array | An ordered collection of one or more Caliper [Event](#event) and/or [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* objects.  The Sensor MAY mix [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* data in the same [Envelope](#envelope). | Required |

### <a name="jsonldPayload"></a>5.3 JSON-LD Payload

Each [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* transmitted inside an [Envelope](#envelope) MUST be serialized as a [JSON-LD](#jsonld) document.

### <a name="httpRequest"></a>5.4 HTTP Requests

A Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be capable of transmitting Caliper data successfully to a Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint).  Communication with an [Endpoint](#endpoint) is limited to message exchanges using the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) with the connection encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

Each message request MUST consist of a single JSON representation of a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope).  Messages MUST be sent using the POST request method.  The HTTP `Host` and `Content-Type` request header fields MUST be set.  

A [Sensor](#sensor) SHOULD also set the `Authorization` request header field using the "Bearer" authentication scheme described in [RFC 6750](#rfc6750), [Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2).  The `b64token` authorization credential sent by a [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be one the [Endpoint](#endpoint) can validate although the credential MAY be opaque to the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) itself.

| Request Header | Description | Disposition |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Authorization | Set the string value to a bearer token using the "Bearer" authentication scheme described in [RFC 6750](#rfc6750), [Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2) (e.g., Authorization: Bearer \<token value\>). | Recommended |
| Content-Type | Set the string value to the IANA media type "application/json". | Required |
| Host | Set the string value to the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested. | Required |

## <a name="endpoint"></a>6.0 Endpoint

A Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint) MUST be capable of receiving Caliper data sent over HTTP by a Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) using the standard POST request method.  The connection MUST be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and a valid TLS certificate provided. The [Endpoint](#endpoint) MUST be capable of accessing standard HTTP request headers and support message authentication that utilizes the HTTP `Authorization` request header "Bearer" authentication scheme as described in [RFC 6750](#rfc6750), [Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2).

### <a name="httpResponse"></a>6.1 HTTP Responses

Following receipt of a [Sensor](#sensor) request message the [Endpoint](#endpoint) MUST reply with a response message.  The response will include a three-digit status code indicating whether or not the [Endpoint](#endpoint) was able to understand and satisfy the request as defined by [RFC 7231](#rfc7231).

* To signal a [Sensor](#sensor) that it has successfully received an emitted [Envelope](#envelope) an [Endpoint](#endpoint) MUST reply with a `2xx` class status code. The [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD use the `200 OK` response but MAY instead choose to send a `201 Created` response (to indicate successful receipt of the message and creation of a new resource) or a `202 Accepted` response (to indicate successful acceptance of the message and queueing for further processing). The body of a successful response SHOULD be empty.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a message containing events and or entities without an enclosing [Envelope](#envelope), the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD reply with a `400 Bad Request` response.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a malformed Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) (it does not contain `sensor`, `sendTime`, `dataVersion` and `data` properties of the required form), the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD reply with a `400 Bad Request` response.  Note that the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD NOT send a `400 Bad Request` response if the [Envelope](#envelope) contains a `dataVersion` value that the [Endpoint](#endpoint) cannot support; in this case, the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD send a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response instead.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a message with a `Content-Type` other than "application/json", the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD reply with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a message without an `Authorization` request header of the RECOMMENDED form or sends a token credential that the [Endpoint](#endpoint) is unable to either validate or determine has sufficient privileges to submit Caliper data, the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD reply with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

The [Endpoint](#endpoint) MAY respond to [Sensor](#sensor) messages with other standard HTTP status codes to indicate result dispositions that vary from the cases described above.  The [Endpoint](#endpoint) MAY also communicate more detailed information about problem states, using the standard method for reporting problem details described in [RFC 7807](#rfc7807).

Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint) implementers should bear in mind that some Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) implementations may lack sophisticated error handling.

### <a name="stringLengths"></a>6.2 String Lengths and Storage

Certain Caliper data properties are expressed as strings of variable length.  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) also defines a set of processing algorithms for transforming [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents in ways that can change the length of keys and values that are expressed as [IRIs](#iridDef), compact [IRIs](#iridDef) or [Terms](#termDef).  Many implementers will choose to store each incoming [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *[describe](#describeDef)* received as a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document or as a graph data structure consisting of nodes, edges and properties.  Others may opt to normalize or "flatten" some or all of the nested JSON objects that comprise a Caliper [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity).  If the chosen persistence strategy involves normalizing Caliper semi-structured data, care should be taken to ensure that strings of character data can be stored without truncation.  See [Appendix G. Minimum Supported String Lengths](#minSupportedStringLengths) for a list of Caliper data properties and recommended *minimum* string lengths.
   
## <a name="actions"></a>Appendix A. Actions

Caliper includes a vocabulary of actions for describing learning interactions. Each action [Term](#termdef) is based on the past-tense form of an English (en-US) verb.  An action [Term](#termdef) can also indicate a change in a particular characteristic of the `object` (e.g., resolution, size, speed, volume).  Each action [Term](#termdef) is mapped to a persistent [IRI](#iriDef) listed in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  Each action is also linked to a brief definition ("gloss") derived in whole or in part from Princeton University's WordNet&reg; project in order to eliminate ambiguity and aid natural language processing.
 
 Each Caliper [Event](#event) type supports one or more of the actions listed below.  The [Event](#event) `action` property string value MUST be set to the appropriate [Term](#termDef). Only one action may be specified per [Event](#event).
